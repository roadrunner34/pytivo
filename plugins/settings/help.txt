Instructions

To Edit a Share: Select the share in the left hand menu.
To Delete a Share: Select the share in the left hand menu and click 
delete.
To Add a Share/Tivo/Section: Click the "Add Section" button.  Then 
provide the name of the share or TiVo. You must save your changes before 
you can edit settings in the new share.
To Add a Setting: Select your share first.  If the setting is a known 
setting simply add the value to the appropriate setting. If the setting 
is not listed you can add a "User Defined Setting".  Simple click add 
setting and provide the name and value of this new setting.
To Delete a Setting: Delete the value of the setting so that it is 
blank.  If this is a known share the name will remain after a save. If 
the setting is a user defined setting the name will be deleted after the 
save.
Save Settings: Clicking Save Settings will write your changes to the 
pyTivo.conf file. These settings may not have an effect on your pyTivo 
server until it is Soft Reset or restarted.
Soft Reset: Soft Reset allows most new settings to take effect without 
restarting pyTivo.  The Soft Reset will cause a re-read of the
pyTivo.conf file so your changes must be saved to the file before the
reset.

Add_a_New_Section

Add the name of a new section: If you want to add a TiVo section, 
remember it must start with "_tivo_". You must save your settings before 
the new section will be editable.

port

Default Setting: 9032
Valid Entries: 1-65535
Required: No
Description: The port which pyTivo uses to serve your files. Can be
changed if it conflicts with another program.
Example Settings: 9032
Available In: Server

ffmpeg

Default Setting: None
Valid Entries: Operating system path
Required: No
Description: This is the full path to your ffmpeg binary. If not set, 
pyTivo checks for it in a "bin" subdirectory, and then in the PATH. If 
no ffmpeg is found, pyTivo will operate in a limited mode, serving only 
MPEG and TiVo files in video shares, and only MP3 files in music shares, 
with no seek capability.
Example Settings: Linux = /usr/bin/ffmpeg |
>Windows = C:\pyTivo\bin\ffmpeg.exe
Available In: Server

tivodecode

Default Setting: None
Valid Entries: Operating system path
Required: No
Description: This is the full path to your tivodecode binary. If not 
set, pyTivo checks for it in a "bin" subdirectory, and then in the PATH.
tivodecode is only needed for certain functions (currently transcoding 
HD .TiVo files to SD).
Example Settings: Linux = /usr/bin/tivodecode |
>Windows = C:\pyTivo\bin\tivodecode.exe
Available In: Server

tdcat

Default Setting: None
Valid Entries: Operating system path
Required: No
Description: This is the full path to your tdcat binary. If not set, 
pyTivo checks for it in a "bin" subdirectory, and then in the PATH. 
tdcat is only needed to view the data from a .TiVo file in the details 
screen. It comes with tivodecode.
Example Settings: Linux = /usr/bin/tdcat |
>Windows = C:\pyTivo\bin\tdcat.exe
Available In: Server

beacon

Default Setting: 255.255.255.255
Valid Entries: Beacon IP address(es) or "listen".  Can contain multiple
IPs separated by spaces.
Required: No
Description: The addresses on which the beacon should broadcast.  Most
people can leave this at the default. If set to "listen", will accept
incoming TCP beacons. If you're having issues with your shares not
appearing on TiVo, try using the broadcast address of your LAN. For
example, if your gateway (router) used address 192.168.1.1, your
broadcast address would be 192.168.1.255.  Alternatively, you can
specify the exact addresses of your TiVos, e.g. 192.168.1.150
192.168.1.151.
Example Settings: 192.168.1.255
Available In: Server

debug

Mode: checkbox
Default Setting: False
Valid Entries: True/False
Required: No
Description: Will generate more output for debugging purposes.
Example Settings: True/False
Available In: Server

type

Mode: select
Default Setting: None
Valid Entries: video, music, photo, or any other valid plugin name.
Required: Yes
Description: Sets the type of share that this will be. This must be set
to something otherwise pyTivo will not start. NOTE plugins names are
generally lowercase.
Example Settings: video, music, photo
Available In: Shares

path

Default Setting: None
Valid Entries: Any operating system path
Required: Yes
Description: Sets the base path to your media content. While pyTivo will
start with an invalid path your shares will not work at all.
Example Settings: Windows = C:\videos | Linux = /home/user/media
Available In: Shares

force_alpha

Mode: checkbox
Default Setting: False
Valid Entries: True/False
Required: No
Description: Only meaningful in shares of type "video". When false, 
pyTivo will display videos in the order requested by the TiVo, as 
described at the bottom of the screen. When true, pyTivo will ignore the 
sort options and revert to its "classic" behavior, using an alphabetical 
sort always, with folders listed first. Note that the TiVo doesn't 
request alpha sorts for folders below the top level, so if you want them 
alpha-sorted, you need this option.
Example Settings: True/False
Available In: Shares

force_ffmpeg

Mode: checkbox
Default Setting: False
Valid Entries: True/False
Required: No
Description: Only meaningful in shares of type "music". When false, 
pyTivo will pass through TiVo-compatible MP3 files as-is (unless you 
seek within them). When true, even these files will be processed by 
FFmpeg, in order to strip out album artwork that the TiVo would 
otherwise try to play as sound, producing a squeal. This is done with 
the "copy" codec, so it's low-overhead.
Example Settings: True/False
Available In: Shares

allow_recurse

Mode: select
Options: Auto/On/Off
Default Setting: Auto
Valid Entries: On/Off/Auto
Required: No
Description: Only meaningful in shares of type "video". The TiVo uses 
the "Recurse" option in a query to provide a flattened, ungrouped 
listing. Recent versions of the TiVo software sometimes forget the 
grouping flag, and unexpectedly request an ungrouped list. So, the 
default now is to ignore the "Recurse" flag on those platforms. This 
option lets you enable it anyway ("Yes"), or force it to be ignored even 
on TiVos that aren't recognized as having the bug ("No").
Example Settings: On/Off/Auto
Available In: Shares

optres

Mode: checkbox
Default Setting: False
Valid Entries: True/False
Required: No
Description: Allows for the use of the Optimal Resolution in
transcoding. By setting optres = true pyTivo will treat the height and
width settings in the conf file as a maximum. If the video to be
transcoded has smaller dimensions that are closer to other acceptable
TiVo dimensions then pyTivo will use these dimensions. This allows for
faster transcoding and small files when the initial video is a lower
quality. pyTivo uses the same resolution as the source file on HD Tivos
for optimal transcoding efficiency. It is not necessary to to set this
option with HD TiVos unless you wish to force pyTivo to change the
resolution to an "S2 compatible" resolution.
Example Settings: True/False
Available In: Tivos, FK_tivos, HD_tivos, SD_tivos

video_br

Default Setting: 4096K for SD TiVo's, 16384K for HD TiVo's
Valid Entries: Any valid Bit rate. 1024K = 1Mi
Required: No
Description: This allows you to choose the default server video bit rate
used in transcoding. FFmpeg does not strictly follow this bit rate,
there is a certain level of tolerance that is allowed. Also a low
quality file will always have a low bit rate. The default is likely fine
for most users. Higher values may slow down transcoding and will
increase the file size. Increased file sizes take up more room on the
TiVo and take longer to transfer over the network. (Higher settings are
>recommended for screen sizes above 47" such as: video_br=20Mi, width=1920,
height=1080)
Example Settings: 4096K, 8Mi, 12Mi, 16Mi, 20Mi
Available In: Tivos, FK_tivos, HD_tivos, SD_tivos

max_video_br

Default Setting: 30000k
Valid Entries: Any valid Bit rate. 1024K = 1Mi
Required: No
Description: This allows you to choose the maximum bit rate and is more
strict than the video_br setting above. However setting this can cause
buffer overflows and can cause issues with ffmpeg. In addition to
setting the ffmpeg maxrate option, this setting is used to determine if
the video bitrate of the source video file is too high for the TiVo.
Otherwise compatible mpeg's with a video bitrate above this setting will
be transcoded rather than sent to the TiVo untouched.  Lower this
setting below the bitrate of your source file if you wish to force high
bitrate sources to be transcoded.  Recommended only for skilled users.
Note: there is a report that ffmpeg throws an error with 17Mi but
accepts 17408K just fine.
Example Settings: 17408k, 30000k
Available In: Tivos, FK_tivos, HD_tivos, SD_tivos

bufsize

Default Setting: 1024k for S2, 4096k for S3
Valid Entries: Any valid byte size
Required: No
Description: Allows you to set the buffer size used by ffmpeg.
Increasing this setting will allow higher bitrates during transcoding
(see video_br setting), especially when transcoding to HD resolutions.
But it may result in pixelation or audio sync issues with some sources.
1024k is fine for the resolutions used by S2 tivos.  But 2048k or 4096k
is preferred for HD tivos.  Leave this setting blank unless you are
experiencing audio/video sync issues and wish to test a different value.
Example Settings: 1024k, 2048k, 4096k
Available In: Tivos, FK_tivos, HD_tivos, SD_tivos

audio_br

Default Setting: same bitrate as source or 448k
Valid Entries: Any valid bitrate up to 448k
Required: No
Description: This allows you to choose the default audio bit rate used
for transcoding. The default is likely fine for most users. 384k is the
minimum recommended for ac3 audio.
Example Settings: 192K, 384K, 448K.
Available In: Tivos, FK_tivos, HD_tivos, SD_tivos

max_audio_br

Default Setting: 448k
Valid Entries: Any valid bitrate
Required: No
Description: This sets the maximum audio bit rate that can be sent to
the TiVo. Files having a higher bit rate will be transcoded to ensure
TiVo compatibility.
Example Settings: 384K, 448K
Available In: Tivos, FK_tivos, HD_tivos, SD_tivos

audio_lang

Recommended Setting: 5.1, DTS, en  (entire string including commas)
pyTivo Defaults To: first audio stream
Valid Entries: any language tag or audio stream number reported by ffmpeg
Required: No
Description: Sets the preferred language track used by pyTivo.
ffmpeg/pytivo defaults to the first audio stream.  Specifying this
parameter, tells pyTivo to use the first audio stream that matches this
entry if more than one audio stream exists.  If your video source does
not have language tags, you may specify the audio stream number reported
by ffmpeg (ie. 0.1, 0.2 ect.). Stream references like 0x80, 0x81, etc.
may also be specified.  pyTivo will transcode the file if necessary to
obtain the preferred language track.<br><br>
You can also assign new language tags to your files by adding Override
lines to your metadata txt files.  This will enable pytivo to detect
your audio language setting in files that do not contain language tags.
The syntax is<br>
Override_mapAudio: 0.1 eng<br>
Where 0.1 is the audio stream number reported by ffmpeg and eng is the 
new audio tag to assign to that stream.  You can specify multiple 
streams with one Override line --<br>
Override_mapAudio: 0:1 eng 0:2 "long tag" 0:3 foo<br>
Example Settings: eng, ger, spa, en, ge, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0x80, 0x81 etc...
Available In: Tivos, FK_tivos, HD_tivos, SD_tivos

ffmpeg_pram

Default Setting: None
Valid Entries: A valid ffmpeg command
Required: No
Description: This allows you to append additional raw ffmpeg commands to
the ffmpeg template. For example, you would enter '-threads 2' here if
you have multiple processors and want ffmpeg to use both processors to
speed up transcoding.
Example Settings: -threads 2
Available In: Server, Tivos, FK_tivos, HD_tivos, SD_tivos

aspect169

Default Setting: True
Valid Entries: True/False
Required: No
Description: Most TiVos, even S2, can handle 16:9 videos perfectly. Some
>S2s are known not to handle 16:9 and will default to false in this
setting. If you are experiencing major distortion you can try setting
this to false. Likely most users will not have to mess with this.
Example Settings: True/False
Available In: Tivos

shares

Default Setting: None (allow all shares on this TiVo).
Valid Entries: The names of any shares in your pyTivo.conf file, in a
comma-separated list.
Required: No
Description: Only the shares listed in this setting will be visible on 
this TiVo. Will ignore invalid shares. If no valid shares are listed, no 
shares will be visible on this TiVo. If the "shares" line is not 
present, all shares are visible.
Example Settings: Movies, Kids Stuff
Available In: Tivos

ffmpeg_wait

Default Setting: 0 (no limit)
Valid Entries: any integer
Required: No
Description: Limits the amount of time FFmpeg can run (when used to 
check file info, not for transcoding), in seconds.
Example Settings: 10, 15, 20.
Available In: Server

tivo_mak

Default Setting: None
Valid Entries: Your Media Access Key
Required: No
Description: Your Media Access Key -- find it on your TiVo under 
Messages and Settings, Account and System information, Media Access Key. 
This is required for the "ToGo" feature, and for anything that uses 
tivodecode (transcoding HD .TiVo files to SD TiVos). If you don't plan 
to use these features, you don't need to set this.
Example Settings: 012345678
Available In: Server, Tivos

togo_path

Default Setting: None
Valid Entries: System path or share name
Required: No
Description: The path used to save programs downloaded via the ToGo 
menu. It can be either a direct path, or the name of a share, in which 
case pyTivo will use the path specified for the share. If you don't plan 
to use the ToGo feature, you need not set this.
Example Settings: My Videos, /home/user/Videos
Available In: Server

zeroconf

Mode: select
Options: Auto/On/Off
Default Setting: Auto
Valid Entries: On/Off/Auto
Required: No
Description: Controls whether or not new-style, zeroconf-based beacons 
are used. The default is to use them, unless there's a "_tivo_" section 
with "shares" defined. The zeroconf beacons bypass the usual mechanism 
whereby only the allowed shares are announced to specific TiVos; the 
contents of the shares will still not appear on unauthorized TiVos, but 
the names will.
Example Settings: On/Off/Auto
Available In: Server

ts

Mode: select
Options: Auto/On/Off
Default Setting: Auto
Valid Entries: On/Off/Auto
Required: No
Description: Should pyTivo use transport stream mode with supported 
TiVos? On = Send only transport streams; Off = Send only program 
streams; Auto = Send as-is if compatible, or as transport stream if the 
source is likely (based on the extension) to be h.264, or program stream 
otherwise. .TiVo files are sent as-is regardless of this setting (unless 
the destination TiVo can't handle transport streams.)
Example Settings: On/Off/Auto
Available In: Server

nosettings

Mode: checkbox
Default Setting: False
Valid Entries: True/False
Required: No
Description: Disable the "Settings" item in the infopage (i.e. the very 
thing you're using now). Note that you can't turn this off the way you 
turned it on, since the settings page will not be available! You'll have 
to remove it from pyTivo.conf with a text editor.
Example Settings: True/False
Available In: Server
